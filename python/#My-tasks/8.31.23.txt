8. *Archiving and Compression:*
    - *Objective:* To get familiar with archiving and compression commands.
    - *Instructions:*
        1. Use the `tar` command to create an archive of the 'practice' directory (e.g., `tar -cvf practice.tar practice/`).
        2. Use the `tar` command with gzip compression to compress the 'practice' directory (e.g., `tar -cvzf practice.tar.gz practice/`).
        3. Use the `tar` command to extract the compressed 'practice.tar.gz' archive (e.g., `tar -xvzf practice.tar.gz`).
        4. Use the `gzip` command to compress a single file like 'example.txt' (e.g., `gzip example.txt`), and then use `gunzip` to decompress it.

9. *Environmental Variables:*
    - *Objective:* To understand environmental variables and their manipulation.
    - *Instructions:*
        1. Use the `echo $SHELL` command to display the type of shell you are using.
        2. Use the `echo $USER` command to display the current logged-in user.
        3. Use the `echo $HOME` command to display the home directory of the current user.
        4. Use the `export` command to create a new environmental variable (e.g., `export MY_VARIABLE="Hello World"`).
        5. Use the `echo` command to display the value of the new environmental variable (e.g., `echo $MY_VARIABLE`).

10. *Text Editing with `vim` or `nano`:*
    - *Objective:* To get familiar with terminal-based text editors.
    - *Instructions:*
        1. Use the `vim` or `nano` command to open 'example.txt' (e.g., `vim example.txt` or `nano example.txt`).
        2. Add some text to the file.
        3. Save the changes and exit the text editor (`:wq` for `vim`, `Ctrl+X` followed by `Y` and `Enter` for `nano`).
  
11. *System Monitoring and Disk Usage:*
    - *Objective:* To understand system resource and disk usage.
    - *Instructions:*
        1. Use the `df` command to display the available disk space on the file system.
        2. Use the `du` command to display the disk usage of a directory or file (e.g., `du -sh practice/`).
        3. Use the `free` command to display the amount of free and used memory on the system.
        4. Use the `top` or `htop` command to monitor system performance in real-time.

12. *Package Management:*
    - *Objective:* To understand how to manage software packages.
    - *Instructions:*
        1. Use the `apt-get` command to update the package list (You might need superuser privileges: `sudo apt-get update`).
        2. Use the `apt-get` command to install a new package (e.g., `sudo apt-get install htop`).
        3. Use the `apt-get` command to remove a package (e.g., `sudo apt-get remove htop`).
